If you have played or followed the development of Dwarf Fortress, you may have at some point heard of [Goblin Camp](http://www.goblincamp.com/). Goblin Camp is "a roguelike citybuilder, inspired by Anno 1404, Dwarf Fortress and Dungeon Keeper."

Goblin Camp was originally developed by Ilkka Halila (ihalila). Development stopped in 2012 at version 0.21.

If I recall correctly, the developer made GC with a few focuses in reaction to some of the perceived negative aspects of Dwarf Fortress; namely, that Goblin Camp, unlike DF, should have a friendly UI and be open source.

I am not a very experienced developer. I have my fundamentals rooted in C++, and my industry experience in PHP. A light skim over the files reveals that this project has C++, C, Python, and C# in it - so I've got some reading to do.

This project will be the first time I pick up a codebase and attempt to sort of "make it my own" - not that I assume I'll be rewriting a whole lot of base functionality, but that I'll be having to understand what's going on.
